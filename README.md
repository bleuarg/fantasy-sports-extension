# Fantasy Sports Extension
This extension adds a `Start active players` button on your Yahoo Fantasy team dashboard to start active players for every day of the remaining week.

I don't think it is useful to set roster for the whole year since with injuries, trades and such, you have to do it again, so I found that a per-week basis is good enough.

## Supported sports
